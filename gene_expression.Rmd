## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}

gene <- read.table(URL,stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header=TRUE)

gene
```

```{r}
str(gene)#to find out the type of data


grep("gene identifiers", rownames(gene))
head(gene)
```
#TABLE FOR THE FIRST SIX GENES
#install.packages("kableExtra")
#devtools::install_github("haozhu233/kableExtra")


#kbl(gene[1:6, 1:6])%>%
#kable_paper(full_width =f, html_font="calibri")


#QUESTION 2
#MAKE A NEW COLUMN WHICH IS THE MEAN OF THE OTHER COLUMNS.SHOW A TABLE FOR THE FIRST SIX GENE


##gene$colMeans <- rowMeans(gene)
#head(gene)
```


#library("kableExtra")
```

#Q3
# LIST THE 10 GENES WITH THE HIGHEST MEAN EXPRESSION


#Q4
#DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF GENES WITH A MEAN <10



#Q5
#MAKE A HISTOGRAM PLOT OF THE MEAN VALUES AND INCLUDE IT INTO YOUR REPORT
